# üç∫ Beer Reviews Analytics & Recommender System Pipeline

## Project Overview
This project implements a **scalable ELT pipeline** to process **4.5 million beer reviews** sourced from Kaggle into analytics-ready formats, and extends into a **hybrid recommender system** using PySpark.  

The pipeline is orchestrated by **Airflow**, transformed with **DBT**, stored in **BigQuery**, and enhanced with a hybrid recommendation engine built with **MLflow**, **DVC**, **FAISS**, and **Git** for reproducibility.  

Future plans include integration with **Vertex AI** for real-time recommendation serving and feature stores.

## Data Sources
The dataset is aggregated from the following Kaggle sources:

1. [RateBeer Dataset ‚Äî 3.0M+ reviews](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mahmoodtopiwala/ratebeer)  
2. [Beer Advocate Dataset ‚Äî 1.5M reviews](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/1-5-million-beer-reviews-from-beer-advocate)  

**Total:** ~4.5 million beer reviews including metadata and user ratings.

## Architecture

### Core Pipeline
1. **Data Ingestion**  
   Kaggle datasets ‚Üí PostgreSQL ‚Üí Google Cloud Storage via Airflow.

2. **Data Transformation**  
   DBT models transform raw data into a **star schema** stored in BigQuery.

3. **Analytics & Reporting**  
   BigQuery hosts the data marts for efficient querying and dashboarding.

---

### Recommender System
- **Data Loading**: PySpark loads transformed data from BigQuery.
- **Modeling**: Hybrid recommendation model combining collaborative filtering and content-based approaches.
- **Tools**:
  - **MLflow** for experiment tracking and model management.
  - **DVC** for dataset versioning and reproducibility.
  - **Git** for code version control.
  - **FAISS** for efficient similarity search and nearest neighbor retrieval.
- **Storage**: Model artifacts stored in MLflow, data stored in DVC.
